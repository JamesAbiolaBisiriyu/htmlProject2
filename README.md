# Delicious Bites Menu

This project is a basic HTML webpage for a fictional restaurant called *Delicious Bites*. The webpage demonstrates the use of semantic HTML tags and common HTML elements including:

- Headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Images for each menu item
- Sections for Appetizers, Main Courses, and Desserts
- A contact link in the footer

It’s designed as a practice project for building structured and visually clear web pages.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Menu items with descriptions and images
- Easy-to-read layout for a restaurant menu
- Placeholder link for contact/reservations
